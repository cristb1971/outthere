So the game concept.

A big-ish playfield - something that takes, say, 5 seconds to traverse at maximum speed.
Drifting bodies.  Several types:
  * Resource asteroids.
  * Random space occupying useless asteroids.
  * impervious asteroids that do damage

Player
Enemies.  The individual enemies aren't much - they are trying to collect resources to put together a hunter vehicle.
  Enemies pound their ships into the resource asteroids, knocking resources out.
  Players can try this, but it damages their ship.
    Instead players should shoot resource asteroids to free up resources. 
    Players can shoot and destroy enemy ships.  And if the enemy ship is carrying a resource, it is dropped.
    Players use the resources to fuel their ships.  Fuel provides movement and firepower.

Hunter vehicle - very fast, hunts the player.  Destroyable, but it's tough.




Concept: shaky asteroids.
  When an asteroid takes a shot or a hit by an enemy, it should be a random value for 
  damage.  When the damage taken over a short period of time exceeds some threshold
  the asteroid should start shaking around.  The more violently it is hit, the more
  violently it shakes.
  When damage available goes to 0 it breaks.

  Big asteroid -> 2 - 4 smaller entities with a chance for a resource to fall out.
    - smaller entities can be either 
      -  useless asteroid  (60%)
      -  resource asteroid (10%)
      -  impervious asteroid (30%)


Concept:  Enemies have no guns.
  So if they get pissed off at the player, they're going to ram him.  That's all they
  have is the ability to ram.  Their pathing should be to swing wide around the player
  and turn on their turbo to accelerate and cause damage.
